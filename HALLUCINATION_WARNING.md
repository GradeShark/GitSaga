# ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: Small LLM Hallucination Risk

## Summary

Small language models (under 7B parameters) like TinyLlama **will corrupt your GitSaga documentation** with hallucinated information. This is not a theoretical risk - it has been observed in production.

## Observed Hallucinations

During testing, TinyLlama (1.1B parameters) demonstrated severe hallucination issues:

1. **Misspelled Project Names**: TinyLlama changed "GitSaga" to "GitSaaga" throughout documentation
2. **Invented Features**: Made up features like "automated branching, parallel builds, dependency tracking" that don't exist
3. **False Root Causes**: Created completely fictional explanations for bugs
4. **Incorrect Solutions**: Generated code that doesn't solve the actual problem
5. **Fabricated Error Messages**: Invented error messages that were never encountered

## Why This Matters

GitSaga captures debugging sessions to create a searchable knowledge base. If this knowledge base contains false information:

- ❌ You'll implement wrong solutions based on fake root causes
- ❌ Team members will waste time on non-existent issues  
- ❌ Your debugging documentation becomes unreliable
- ❌ Future debugging sessions reference corrupted information

## Safe Model Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **7B+ parameters** (absolute minimum)
- Trained on code/technical content
- Low hallucination benchmarks

### Recommended Models
- **Llama 2 7B/13B/70B**: Well-tested, reliable
- **CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B**: Optimized for code understanding
- **Mistral 7B**: Efficient and accurate
- **Mixtral 8x7B**: Excellent for technical content
- **Gemma 7B**: Google's reliable small model

### NEVER Use These Models
- ❌ **TinyLlama** (1.1B) - Severe hallucinations confirmed
- ❌ **Phi/Phi-2** (1.3B/2.7B) - Too small for reliable output
- ❌ **StableLM** (3B) - Insufficient parameters
- ❌ **Pythia** (<7B versions) - Not suitable for production
- ❌ **Any model under 7B parameters**

## Protection Measures in GitSaga v2

1. **Default Safety**: `use_ai=False` by default in AutoChronicler
2. **Model Validation**: Rejects known unsafe models
3. **Explicit Warnings**: Clear warnings in documentation and code
4. **Manual Fallback**: Always works without AI

## How to Safely Use AI Enhancement

### Option 1: Disable AI (Recommended for Most Users)
```bash
# GitSaga works perfectly without AI
saga init  # Don't run setup-ai
```

### Option 2: Use a Safe Model
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull a SAFE model (7B+ only)
ollama pull llama2       # 7B parameters - SAFE
ollama pull codellama    # 7B parameters - SAFE  
ollama pull mistral      # 7B parameters - SAFE

# NEVER pull these
# ollama pull tinyllama  # DANGEROUS - Will corrupt sagas
```

### Option 3: Validate Before Production
If using AI enhancement:
1. Generate a test saga
2. Manually verify ALL information is accurate
3. Check for any made-up features or details
4. Only deploy if 100% accurate

## What If I Already Used TinyLlama?

If you've been using TinyLlama with GitSaga:

1. **Stop immediately** - Disable AI or switch to a 7B+ model
2. **Audit existing sagas** - Review all AI-generated content
3. **Correct hallucinations** - Fix any false information found
4. **Re-capture important sagas** - Use manual capture for critical debugging sessions

## The Bottom Line

**Small models are not just "less accurate" - they actively create false information that will corrupt your debugging knowledge base.**

Either:
- Use GitSaga without AI (recommended)
- Use a 7B+ parameter model (verified safe)
- Never use models under 7B parameters

Your future self debugging at 3 AM will thank you for keeping your sagas accurate.

## Technical Details

### Why Do Small Models Hallucinate?

1. **Insufficient Parameters**: Can't encode enough knowledge
2. **Compression Artifacts**: Information gets corrupted during training
3. **Pattern Matching Failures**: Confuse similar concepts
4. **Limited Context Window**: Lose track of what they're documenting

### Hallucination Examples from Production

```markdown
# What TinyLlama Generated:
"GitSaaga's automated branching system failed due to 
parallel build conflicts in the dependency tracker..."

# Reality:
- GitSaga (not GitSaaga)  
- Has no automated branching system
- Has no parallel builds
- Has no dependency tracker
- The actual bug was a simple typo in a file path
```

This critical issue was discovered by Helper (WSL Claude instance) during cross-platform testing with Builder (Windows Claude instance), demonstrating the importance of thorough testing with different model sizes.
