# Admin-Created Users Email Verification Fix

## Problem Description
When administrators created new users through the admin panel, those users were still prompted to verify their email addresses upon login, despite the intent to auto-verify admin-created accounts. This created unnecessary friction for users who were manually added by administrators.

## Root Cause
The issue had two parts:

1. **Initial Implementation**: The `UserController::store()` method was correctly setting `email_verified_at => now()` when creating users, but this wasn't working due to mass assignment protection.

2. **Mass Assignment Protection**: The `email_verified_at` field was not included in the User model's `$fillable` array, causing Laravel to silently ignore this field during mass assignment operations.

## The Fix

### 1. Updated User Model
Added `email_verified_at` to the fillable array in `/app/Models/User.php`:

```php
protected $fillable = [
    'first_name',
    'last_name',
    'email',
    'password',
    'email_verified_at',  // Added this line
];
```

### 2. Enhanced Admin User Updates
Modified `/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php` to also auto-verify emails when promoting users to admin status:

```php
// In the update() method
$updateData = [
    'first_name' => $validated['first_name'],
    'last_name' => $validated['last_name'],
    'email' => $validated['email'],
];

// If user is becoming an admin and email not verified, auto-verify it
if ($isBecomingAdmin && !$user->hasVerifiedEmail()) {
    $updateData['email_verified_at'] = now();
}

$user->update($updateData);
```

## Impact
- Admin-created users can now log in immediately without email verification
- Users promoted to admin status get auto-verified to prevent access issues
- Streamlined onboarding process for manually added users

## Testing
1. Create a new user via admin panel
2. Log out and log in as the new user
3. User should go directly to dashboard, not verification page
4. Also test promoting an existing unverified user to admin status
