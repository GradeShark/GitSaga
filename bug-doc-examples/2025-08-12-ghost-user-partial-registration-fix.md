## Executive Summary

"Ghost users" are unverified registrations that block email addresses from being reused. When users start registration but never verify their email, their email address remains "taken" in the database indefinitely, preventing them from registering again later. This documentation covers the comprehensive solution implemented to automatically clean up these abandoned registrations and free hostage email addresses.

---

## The Problem

### User Experience Issue
1. User starts registration, enters email `john@example.com`
2. User doesn't complete email verification (email lost, changed mind, etc.)
3. User returns days later to register
4. System says "Email already taken" ❌
5. User is locked out of their own email address
6. No way for user to recover or reset

### Database Impact
- **Accumulation**: Unverified accounts pile up over time
- **Storage Waste**: Ghost records consuming database space
- **Email Hostages**: Legitimate emails permanently blocked
- **Analytics Skew**: User counts inflated with non-users

### Real-World Scenarios
- User's verification email goes to spam
- User has second thoughts and abandons registration
- User makes typo in email, creates another account
- User tests registration without intending to complete
- Network issues during registration process

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happens
1. **Laravel's Default Behavior**: 
   - User record created immediately upon registration
   - Email marked as unique constraint in database
   - No automatic cleanup of unverified accounts

2. **Email Verification Flow**:
   ```
   Registration → User Created → Email Sent → [User Never Verifies] → Email Blocked Forever
   ```

3. **No Built-in Cleanup**: Laravel doesn't provide automatic removal of unverified accounts

---

## The Multi-Layer Solution

Our solution implements three complementary approaches:

### Layer 1: Real-Time Cleanup (Registration Controller)
- Check for existing unverified accounts during registration
- Auto-delete if older than 1 hour
- Inform user if too recent

### Layer 2: Manual Cleanup (Artisan Command)
- Command-line tool for administrators
- Flexible time-based cleanup
- Dry-run capability for safety

### Layer 3: Automated Cleanup (Scheduled Task)
- Daily automatic cleanup
- Removes unverified accounts older than 7 days
- Runs at 2 AM to minimize impact

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Registration Controller Update
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`

```php
public function store(Request $request): RedirectResponse
{
    $request->validate([
        'first_name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
        'last_name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
        'email' => ['required', 'string', 'lowercase', 'email', 'max:255'],
        'password' => ['required', 'confirmed', Rules\Password::defaults()],
    ]);

    // Check for existing unverified account with same email
    $existingUser = User::where('email', $request->email)->first();
    
    if ($existingUser) {
        // If user exists and is verified, email is truly taken
        if ($existingUser->hasVerifiedEmail()) {
            return back()->withErrors(['email' => 'The email has already been taken.'])
                        ->withInput();
        }
        
        // If unverified and older than 1 hour, delete the ghost account
        if ($existingUser->created_at->lt(now()->subHour())) {
            $existingUser->delete();
            \Log::info('Deleted abandoned unverified account: ' . $request->email);
        } else {
            // If recent unverified account, inform user to check email or wait
            return back()->withErrors([
                'email' => 'An account with this email was recently created. Please check your email for verification or try again later.'
            ])->withInput();
        }
    }

    // Continue with normal registration...
    $user = User::create([
        'first_name' => $request->first_name,
        'last_name' => $request->last_name,
        'email' => $request->email,
        'password' => Hash::make($request->password),
    ]);

    // ... rest of registration logic
}
```

### 2. Cleanup Command
**File**: `app/Console/Commands/CleanupUnverifiedUsers.php`

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use App\Models\User;
use Carbon\Carbon;

class CleanupUnverifiedUsers extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'users:cleanup-unverified 
                            {--days=7 : Number of days to wait before cleanup}
                            {--dry-run : Show what would be deleted without actually deleting}';

    protected $description = 'Remove unverified user accounts older than specified days';

    public function handle()
    {
        $days = $this->option('days');
        $dryRun = $this->option('dry-run');
        
        $cutoffDate = Carbon::now()->subDays($days);
        
        // Find unverified users older than cutoff
        $query = User::whereNull('email_verified_at')
            ->where('created_at', '<', $cutoffDate);
            
        $count = $query->count();
        
        if ($count === 0) {
            $this->info("No unverified users older than {$days} days found.");
            return Command::SUCCESS;
        }
        
        if ($dryRun) {
            $this->info("DRY RUN: Would delete {$count} unverified users older than {$days} days:");
            $users = $query->get(['id', 'email', 'created_at']);
            foreach ($users as $user) {
                $this->line("  - ID: {$user->id}, Email: {$user->email}, Created: {$user->created_at}");
            }
        } else {
            $this->info("Deleting {$count} unverified users older than {$days} days...");
            
            // Delete the users
            $deleted = $query->delete();
            
            $this->info("✅ Successfully deleted {$deleted} unverified users.");
        }
        
        return Command::SUCCESS;
    }
}
```

### 3. Scheduled Task
**File**: `routes/console.php`

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Inspiring;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

// ... existing code ...

// Schedule cleanup of unverified users older than 7 days
Schedule::command('users:cleanup-unverified --days=7')
    ->daily()
    ->at('02:00')
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->onOneServer()
    ->runInBackground();
```

---

## Usage & Commands

### Manual Cleanup Commands

#### Preview what would be deleted (Dry Run)
```bash
# See what would be deleted (default 7 days)
php artisan users:cleanup-unverified --dry-run

# Check 30-day old accounts
php artisan users:cleanup-unverified --days=30 --dry-run

# Check 1-day old accounts
php artisan users:cleanup-unverified --days=1 --dry-run
```

#### Actually delete ghost users
```bash
# Delete unverified users older than 7 days (default)
php artisan users:cleanup-unverified

# Delete unverified users older than 1 day
php artisan users:cleanup-unverified --days=1

# Delete unverified users older than 30 days
php artisan users:cleanup-unverified --days=30
```

### Example Output

**Dry Run**:
```
DRY RUN: Would delete 3 unverified users older than 7 days:
  - ID: 15, Email: test@example.com, Created: 2025-08-01 10:30:00
  - ID: 23, Email: john.doe@email.com, Created: 2025-08-03 14:22:00
  - ID: 31, Email: abandoned@test.com, Created: 2025-08-04 09:15:00
```

**Actual Deletion**:
```
Deleting 3 unverified users older than 7 days...
✅ Successfully deleted 3 unverified users.
```

## Testing & Verification

### Test Scenario 1: Immediate Re-registration
1. Register with `test@example.com`
2. Don't verify email
3. Wait 61 minutes
4. Try to register again with same email
5. **Expected**: Registration succeeds, old account deleted

### Test Scenario 2: Recent Registration Protection
1. Register with `test@example.com`
2. Don't verify email
3. Try to register again within 1 hour
4. **Expected**: Message saying to check email or wait

### Test Scenario 3: Manual Cleanup
```bash
# Create test unverified user (if needed)
php artisan tinker
>>> User::create(['email' => 'ghost@test.com', 'password' => bcrypt('test'), 'created_at' => now()->subDays(8)]);

# Run cleanup
php artisan users:cleanup-unverified --dry-run
php artisan users:cleanup-unverified

# Verify deletion
>>> User::where('email', 'ghost@test.com')->exists(); // Should return false
```

### Test Scenario 4: Verified User Protection
1. Create and verify a user account
2. Run cleanup command
3. **Expected**: Verified user NOT deleted

---

## Maintenance & Monitoring

### Monitoring Commands

#### Check current ghost users
```bash
# Count unverified users
php artisan tinker
>>> User::whereNull('email_verified_at')->count();

# See breakdown by age
>>> User::whereNull('email_verified_at')
    ->selectRaw('DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as count')
    ->groupBy('date')
    ->orderBy('date', 'desc')
    ->get();
```

#### Monitor cleanup effectiveness
```bash
# Check Laravel logs for cleanup activity
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "unverified"

# Check scheduled task execution
php artisan schedule:list
```

### Adjusting Cleanup Parameters

#### Change automatic cleanup frequency
In `routes/console.php`:
```php
// Run twice daily instead of once
Schedule::command('users:cleanup-unverified --days=7')
    ->twiceDaily(2, 14);  // 2 AM and 2 PM

// Run weekly instead of daily
Schedule::command('users:cleanup-unverified --days=7')
    ->weekly();

// Run hourly for aggressive cleanup
Schedule::command('users:cleanup-unverified --days=1')
    ->hourly();
```

#### Change registration timeout
In `RegisteredUserController.php`:
```php
// Change from 1 hour to 30 minutes
if ($existingUser->created_at->lt(now()->subMinutes(30))) {

// Change to 2 hours
if ($existingUser->created_at->lt(now()->subHours(2))) {

// Change to 24 hours
if ($existingUser->created_at->lt(now()->subDay())) {
```

### Database Considerations

#### Index Optimization
Consider adding index for better performance:
```sql
-- Add index for unverified user queries
CREATE INDEX idx_users_unverified 
ON users(email_verified_at, created_at) 
WHERE email_verified_at IS NULL;
```

#### Query Performance
Monitor query performance:
```php
// In tinker
>>> DB::enableQueryLog();
>>> User::whereNull('email_verified_at')->where('created_at', '<', now()->subDays(7))->count();
>>> DB::getQueryLog();
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, here's how to disable each layer:

### Disable Real-time Cleanup
In `RegisteredUserController.php`, comment out the cleanup logic:
```php
// if ($existingUser) {
//     ... cleanup logic ...
// }
```

### Disable Scheduled Cleanup
In `routes/console.php`, comment out:
```php
// Schedule::command('users:cleanup-unverified --days=7')
//     ->daily()
//     ->at('02:00');
```

### Remove Command Entirely
```bash
rm app/Console/Commands/CleanupUnverifiedUsers.php
```
