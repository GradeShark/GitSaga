## Original Problem Report

---

## Executive Summary

HTML5 games uploaded to lessons fail to load properly. While the main index.html loads, all game assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, audio) receive 403 Forbidden errors from S3. Multiple fix attempts were made but each introduced new complications. The system has been reverted to a stable state where the bug persists but doesn't affect other functionality.

---

## The Core Problem

### User Report
"I uploaded a game zip file to a lesson, but it is not displaying. The lesson is displaying as blank."

### Technical Issue
- **Current Implementation**: Games are stored in private S3 bucket at paths like `games/game-1754967489/index.html`
- **What Works**: The iframe loads with a signed URL for index.html
- **What Fails**: All relative asset requests (CSS, JS, images) go directly to S3 without authentication
- **Result**: 403 Forbidden errors for every game asset

### Root Cause
S3 bucket has "Block Public Access" enabled (good for security), but HTML5 games need to load dozens/hundreds of files. The current approach only signs the index.html URL, not the assets.

---

## Environment Details

- **S3 Bucket**: `gradeshark` (us-east-2)
- **Bucket Policy**: Block Public Access ENABLED
- **Game Storage Path**: `games/{lesson-slug}-{timestamp}/`
- **Example Game**: Construct 3 HTML5 game with ~50+ files
- **Game Structure**:
  ```
  games/game-1754967489/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ appmanifest.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ data.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ offline.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ sw.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ workermain.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ c3runtime.js
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ supportcheck.js
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ offlineclient.js
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ register-sw.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ images/ (multiple PNG files)
    â”œâ”€â”€ media/ (audio/video files)
    â””â”€â”€ fonts/ (TTF files)
  ```

## Timeline of Fix Attempts

### Attempt 1: Complex Proxy Solution (GameController)
**Approach**: Create controller to proxy all game assets through Laravel
- Rewrite HTML to route all assets through `/lessons/{id}/game/assets/{path}`
- Proxy JS/CSS with CORS headers
- Redirect images/media to signed S3 URLs

**Result**: 
- Complex URL rewriting issues
- Path encoding problems with spaces in filenames
- Module scripts failed due to CORS restrictions
- Black screen - game HTML loaded but runtime never initialized

### Attempt 2: Simple Test Controller (SimpleGameController)
**Approach**: Generate signed URLs for ALL files upfront
- Get all files in game directory
- Create signed URL for each
- Replace all references in HTML

**Result**: Black screen - CORS issues with signed URLs from different origin

### Attempt 3: Direct Serving (DirectGameController)
**Approach**: Serve everything through Laravel
- Route: `/lessons/{id}/game-direct/{file}`
- Cache files for performance
- Add base tag to HTML for relative URLs

**Result**: 
- Files served successfully (no 404s)
- Construct 3 runtime detected but didn't initialize
- Service worker issues in iframe context
- Game remained black screen

### Attempt 4: Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Public games folder**: Blocked by S3 "Block Public Access" settings
- **CloudFront CDN**: Would work but adds complexity
- **Subdomain for games**: Requires infrastructure changes

---

## Current Stable Implementation

```php
// LessonController.php
if ($lesson->game_path) {
    $secureGameUrl = Storage::disk('s3')->temporaryUrl($lesson->game_path, now()->addHours(4));
}

// lessons/show.blade.php
@if($secureGameUrl)
    <div class="game-container" data-game-url="{{ $secureGameUrl }}">
        <iframe src="{{ $secureGameUrl }}" frameborder="0" class="w-full h-full flex-grow secure-game-iframe"></iframe>
    </div>
@endif
```

**Problem**: Only signs index.html, not the assets it needs.

## Why Previous Solutions Failed

### 1. **CORS Restrictions**
- S3 signed URLs from different origin trigger CORS
- Module scripts (`type="module"`) have stricter CORS requirements
- Browsers block cross-origin script execution

### 2. **Service Worker Conflicts**
- Construct 3 games try to register service workers
- Service workers in iframes cause security issues
- Can't register SW from different origin

### 3. **Dynamic Loading**
- Games load assets dynamically via JavaScript
- URL rewriting in HTML doesn't catch dynamic requests
- Runtime uses relative imports that bypass rewrites

### 4. **Performance Issues**
- Proxying all assets through Laravel is slow
- Caching helps but initial load still problematic
- 50+ files Ã— network latency = poor user experience

## Recommended Solution Path

### Option 1: CloudFront with Signed Cookies (RECOMMENDED)
```
1. Create CloudFront distribution for S3 bucket
2. Use signed cookies for time-limited access
3. Games load from CDN with proper CORS headers
4. Single authentication check, then direct CDN access
```

**Pros**: Fast, secure, scales well  
**Cons**: AWS setup complexity

### Option 2: Make Games Folder Public
```
1. Modify S3 bucket policy to allow public read on /games/*
2. Keep unguessable paths for security through obscurity
3. Add referrer checking or IP restrictions
```

**Pros**: Simple, works immediately  
**Cons**: Requires disabling Block Public Access partially

### Option 3: Separate Game Server
```
1. Deploy simple Node.js server for games
2. Proxy with proper CORS headers
3. Handle authentication via JWT tokens
```

**Pros**: Full control, optimized for games  
**Cons**: Additional infrastructure

### Option 4: Pre-process Games on Upload
```
1. During upload, modify game files
2. Convert relative URLs to absolute signed URLs
3. Inline small assets as data URLs
4. Generate manifest of signed URLs
```

**Pros**: Works with current setup  
**Cons**: Complex processing, may break some games

## Testing Checklist for Solution

- [ ] Game loads without console errors
- [ ] All assets load (check Network tab)
- [ ] Game is playable and interactive
- [ ] Audio/video files play correctly
- [ ] No CORS errors in console
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (<3s load time)
- [ ] Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Works in iframe context
- [ ] Service workers don't interfere with main app
- [ ] CloudWatch costs remain reasonable

---

## Key Files to Review

1. `/app/Http/Controllers/LessonController.php` - Current game URL generation
2. `/resources/views/lessons/show.blade.php` - Game iframe implementation
3. `/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/LessonController.php` - Game upload/extraction logic
4. `/config/filesystems.php` - S3 configuration
5. Game example at S3: `games/game-1754967489/` - Test game structure

---

## Critical Constraints

1. **S3 Block Public Access**: Currently enabled for security
2. **Private Bucket**: All content requires authentication
3. **Laravel + S3**: Must work within this architecture
4. **Cost Sensitivity**: Solution must not dramatically increase AWS costs
5. **User Experience**: Games should load quickly and work reliably

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't underestimate CORS complexity** with private S3 buckets
2. **HTML5 games are essentially web apps** with complex resource loading
3. **Service workers and iframes don't mix well**
4. **Signed URLs work for single files**, not for applications with many assets
5. **Simple solutions (public folder) may be better** than complex proxying

---

## Next Steps for New Engineer

1. **Understand the game structure** - Download and examine the test game
2. **Review S3 bucket settings** - Understand current security configuration
3. **Test in isolation** - Try loading game outside of iframe first
4. **Consider infrastructure changes** - CloudFront or partial public access
5. **Prototype solution** - Test with simple HTML file before full game
6. **Performance test** - Ensure solution scales to 100+ file games

---

## Contact for Context

- **Original Issue**: User reported blank lesson when game uploaded
- **Test Game**: Lesson ID 3, path `games/game-1754967489/`
- **Browser Testing**: Chrome 138 on Windows, localhost environment
- **S3 Bucket**: gradeshark (us-east-2), Block Public Access enabled

---

**Final Note**: The core challenge is serving an entire HTML5 application (with dozens of interdependent files) from a private S3 bucket through a Laravel application while maintaining security, performance, and proper CORS handling. The previous engineer recommends considering infrastructure-level solutions (CloudFront) rather than application-level workarounds.
