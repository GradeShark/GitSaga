# RESOLVED: Vite Development Server Not Running - ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE

## Bug Report
**Date Discovered**: January 2025  
**Severity**: High  
**Environment**: Local development (localhost)

### Symptoms
- Localhost showing completely unstyled HTML (no CSS applied)
- Browser console error: `GET http://localhost:5173/@vite/client net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`
- Site appears completely broken with no styling or JavaScript functionality
- Page loads but looks like raw HTML without any formatting

### Root Cause
When `APP_ENV=local` in the `.env` file, Laravel expects the Vite development server to be running on port 5173 to serve hot-reloaded assets. If the Vite dev server isn't running, the browser cannot load CSS and JavaScript files, resulting in unstyled pages.

## Solution Implemented

### Immediate Fix
Started the Vite development server:
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
```

### Long-term Prevention
Documented in the admin manual that three terminals are required for local development:
1. **Terminal 1**: `sail up -d` (Docker containers)
2. **Terminal 2**: `sail artisan horizon` (Queue processing)  
3. **Terminal 3**: `sail npm run dev` (Asset compilation) ‚Üê Often forgotten!

### Alternative Solution
For quick fixes without hot reloading:
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build
```
This creates static assets that work without the dev server.

## Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `/home/medcomic/gradeshark/docs/admin/COMPLETE_ADMIN_MANUAL.md`
- **Section Added**: Common Development Environment Issues (lines 69-127)
- **Configuration**: Vite expects to serve from `http://localhost:5173/` when in local mode

## Verification
After starting Vite dev server:
- CSS and JavaScript load properly
- Hot module replacement works
- Console errors disappear
- Site displays with full styling

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify all required services are running in development
2. The Vite dev server is essential for local development, not optional
3. Clear documentation prevents repeated issues
4. ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE specifically indicates missing dev server, not network issues
