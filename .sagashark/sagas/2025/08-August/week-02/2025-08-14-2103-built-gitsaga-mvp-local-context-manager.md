## Problem
We need a local development context manager that captures debugging sessions.

## Solution  
Created GitSaga - a git-native context management system that:
- Stores sagas as markdown files in .gitsaga/
- Provides fast text-based search
- Integrates with git for branch context
- Runs 100% locally with no cloud dependencies

## Lessons Learned
- Start simple with text search, add vectors later
- Git-like CLI commands feel natural
- Local-first architecture removes all friction
